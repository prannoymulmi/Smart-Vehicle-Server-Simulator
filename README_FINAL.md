.\venv\Scripts\activate.bat 

# upgrade pip to get the latest packages
python -m pip install --upgrade pip 

#Is used to check if the virtual environment is being used 
pip3 -V  

# Install all required dependencies
pip3 install -r requirements.txt 
```

Python applications which simulates the communication between a smart car and a cloud server the data-flow-diagram show
the system which this project is trying to simulate.

### Model Specification under test
![alt text](docs/DFD.png)
Figure 1: DFD Diagram

Figure 1 shows the communication between the client (which includes different components in the smart vehicles) and server (cloud). The data from the different components are communicated through the wireless connection to the server in the cloud. The data received from the smart vehicles is processed in the cloud.  

## Hypothesis

This project delves into the hypothesis: 
```
Is it more secure and effective to use passwords or use passwordless authentication to
communicate with the server?
```
## Analysis
### Password Authentication
The python file ```server_ssl.py``` mimics the server as shown in the DFD in Figure 1,
which stores the password in a hashed format using Argon2-id algorithm using RFC 9106 with High memory recommended parameters, that is resistant to GPU-based attacks, rainbow-table and side-channel attacks (Biryukov, A., Dinu, D, 2016).

```python
# hashes the password into argon2id with random salt
# Using the first recommendation per RFC 9106 with High memory.
HASHED_SECRET = '$argon2id$v=19$m=2097152,t=1,p=4$vT7UexZFsNYigbn2flmJRg$yIOPV3spwnNUIvfFb4B7EMSDh31E3u2C5DOc7Kplljs'
```
#### Issue for password authentication
Due to the greater connectivity of the IoT devices, it poses great challenge in the scalability in terms of the use of the password-based authentication. The connected nature of the IoT devices and each device requesting for authentication through password to the cloud and other devices makes 
it hard to scale at large connected systems (SecureIDNews, 2015).

### Passwordless Authentication
To carry out passwordless authentication a symmetric key-based protocol (public and private key) is used for a
passwordless authentication. This asymmetric authentication (passwordless) method is straightforward and resilient to many
known attacks like Man-in-the-Middle and brute-force attacks (Bruce, N. and Lee, H.J., 2014). This method provides a simple authentication method, which would be feasible for most low-resourced IoT devices.

````bash
## How to generate keys for passwordless authentication Source (OpenSSL Project, 2021)
## This generates a 2048 bits length key
openssl genpkey -algorithm RSA -out client_private_key.pem
openssl pkey -in client_private_key.pem -pubout -out client_public_key.pem
````

#### Issue for passwordless
However, one of the main challenges for this
type of authentication is the size of the certificates/keys, which have a rather complex structure and is resource intensive, which would create
difficulties processing and verifying them as IoT devices have minimal resources (Schukat, M. and Cortijo, P., 2015).

## Conclusion
By carrying the two experiments (refer to Word document), it can be concluded that passwordless 
authentication using certificates are more secure than password, given they are used and 
appropriately stored, i.e. HSM module in IoT, as it is harder to carry out brute-force attacks 
easily as for password authentication, especially when they are weak.

In contrast, password authentication is more efficient to use when the client has limited 
resources, as passwordless authentication with certificates uses more computing power.

Therefore, password authentication is recommended for low-powered devices such as IoT; 
however, they should be strong passwords that are not easily guessable. Nevertheless, if 
the smart car client possesses enough computing power, passwordless authentication with 
certificates provides better security. In addition to that, strong passwords must be used, 
and for the certificates, the proper key algorithm and key length should be used, i.e., 
RSA-2048 stored in a secure storage like an HSM in an IoT device.
